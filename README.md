This program allows you to create multiplying automated browsers. 
Create 'n' browsers that all navigate to a pre-determined site or perform a certain action.
If any of the browsers in the set is closed, 
create (n + 1) browsers and display them dynamically so that they occupy the entire screen and do not overlap.
