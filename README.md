This code creates a set of automated browser windows that each navigate to a pre-determined site or perform a certain action.
If any browser in the set closes, a new set is created that is one larger than the previous set.
They will be displayed dynamically based on the size of the set so that they occupy the entire screen and do not overlap.

Ex. If 2 windows are open, and either closes, 3 new windows will open.
